Mahfoud Bennoune was a human rights activist who spoke out against injustice—even when his opinions put him in danger.

Mr. Bennoune, a native of Algeria, died from complications of amyloidosis, an auto immune illness, on Monday, May 17, 2004. He was 68.

He fought in the Army of National Liberation against the French during the Algerian War of Independence. He was captured by French forces and sent to a POW camp.

He was released after the war, and in 1967 he moved to Metro Detroit. In 1976, he earned a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Michigan.

Mr. Bennoune returned to Algeria in 1981. He worked as a professor at the University of Algiera in 1981. He worked as a professor at the University of Algiers, and was critical of both the Algerian government and the fundamentalist religious groups that fought against it. 

He came home one day and found a note on his dining room table that read, 'consider yourself dead.' Fearing for his safety, Mr. Bennoune moved out of the apartment—but he remained in Algeria speaking out against injustices he saw.

Mr. Bennoune authored several books written in Arabic, French and English. His works included *The Making of Contemporary Algeria.* 

Survivors include a daughter, Karima; and a son, Kamal.
